# Project Description: Data Wrangling and Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I performed data wrangling and analysis on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about companies, including revenue, category, and company name. The primary objective of this project was to prepare the data for analysis by identifying and addressing any issues such as duplicates, inconsistencies, and errors.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of several columns, including:
- Company Name
- Revenue
- Category
- Other relevant columns

## Data Wrangling Process
1. **Data Acquisition**: I obtained the dataset from Kaggle, ensuring it contained the necessary information for analysis.
2. **Data Inspection**: I inspected the dataset to understand its structure, size, and contents.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
    - **Duplicate Entries**: I checked for and removed any duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
    - **Data Types**: I examined the data types of each column to ensure they were appropriate for the data they contained. I converted data types where necessary.
    - **Data Cleaning**: I performed cleaning operations on various columns to address inconsistencies, errors, and missing values.
    - **Standardization**: I standardized company names to ensure consistency across the dataset.
4. **Data Analysis**:
    - I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
    - I identified the top 10 companies in India based on revenue.
    - I calculated the total revenue generated by all companies in the dataset.
    - I explored different categories present in the dataset.

## Conclusion
Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis. By performing data wrangling and analysis on the dataset, I was able to gain valuable insights into the companies' data, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

## Future Steps
- Further analysis: Conduct deeper analysis on specific aspects of the data to uncover more insights.
- Visualization: Create visualizations to present the findings in a clear and concise manner.
- Model Building: Explore the possibility of building predictive models based on the dataset.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data wrangling and analysis process.
- **Reports**: Contains reports, visualizations, and findings from the analysis.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project and instructions for replicating the analysis.
